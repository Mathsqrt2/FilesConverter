# Files Converter

### üî® About the Project 

> (application under development, the description below refers to the target state.)

**Files Converter** is a scalable application based on a microservice architecture that allows, through a simple graphical interface, to compress files, change their format, resolution, crop them, and, after processing, return them as a single ZIP file or as multiple files if the package size exceeds 16 GB. It also offers the ability to generate an image or convert audio to text using [**AI**](https://ollama.com/). All files are available for 7 days for a basic user and for 30 days for a premium user. After this period, a scheduler automatically deletes them. Access to the files, their metadata, and account statistics is provided through a [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) API.

### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mathsqrt2/AI_Talks.git
```

#### 2. Environment Variable Configuration

The application includes default environmental settings for basic functionality.
However, if you want anything else for any purpose, you can 
configure these everything in a [.env](./backend/.env.d.ts) file.

#### 3. Build Docker Container

Make sure Docker is installed, then run:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile prod up -d -V --build
```

### üìÑ Documentation

All available functionalities and system behavior are described in the [GraphQL Playground](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/v2/testing/graphql-playground) documentation.
It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test API endpoints directly from the browser.
You can check available routes, required parameters, and expected responses.
The documentation is automatically generated and accessible at:

```http
GET http://localhost:13000/api/v1/graphql
```
